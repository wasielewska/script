# script
Before starting work with the repository, we clone the remote repository on our computer git clone <repository link>
Ð¡reating new directories mkdir <directory name> 
git status - command checks the status of the files in our directory
If we have files with the "modified" status displayed, then we need to prepare these files for saving in the repository using the command git add <file name>
If many files have the status "modified", then all of them can be saved with the command git add -A
To display changes in the repository and save all files, create a commit with the command git commit -am "commit message text" 
Start synchronization from the local repository to the remote one with the git push command
With the ls -l command, we check the list of files in the directory and the rights to them 
To give permission to run a file to all types of users, use the command chmod + x <file name>
